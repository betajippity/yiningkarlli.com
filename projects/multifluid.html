				<div class="subtitle">Overview</div>
				<p>For our spring 2012 <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis563/Spring2012/">CIS563: Physically Based Animation</a> final project, my friend Dan Knowlton and I developed a liquid simulator, nicknamed "Project Chocolate Syrup". Based on the paper <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1141960">Multiple Interacting Liquids</a> by Losasso et al, our simulator is capable of simulating multiple liquids with various properties interacting with an environment and with each other. Our system utilizes some base code (listed below), but has been heavily modified, customized, and extended to fit the needs of this project. This project is written entirely in C++.
			</div>
			
			<div class="projecttextrow">
				<div class="subtitle">Base Code</div>
				<p>Our project utilizes base code from the following sources:
				<p>1. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~batty/">Christopher Batty</a>'s Fluid3D framework, <a href="https://github.com/christopherbatty/Fluid3D">available on Github</a>.
				<p>2. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~batty/">Christopher Batty</a>'s SDFGen OBJ to signed-distance-field convertor, <a href="https://github.com/christopherbatty/SDFGen">available on Github</a>.
				<p>3. <a href="http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/">Paul Bourke</a>'s Marching Cubes example, <a href="http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/polygonise/source/">available here</a>.

				<div class="subtitle">Features</div>
				<div class="projecttextleftbar">
					<p><b>Semi-Lagrangian Fluid Simulation: </b>The simulation works in a semi-lagrangian fashion by advecting particles through a MAC grid structure and solving fluid states using a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient solver much like the one described in <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/">Robert Bridson</a>'s 2007 SIGGRAPH <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/fluidsimulation/">Fluid Simulation Course Notes</a>.
					<p><b>Multiple Liquids: </b>Support for simulating an arbitrary number of distinct liquids simultaneously against both each other and solid objects in a scene.
					<p><b>Level-Set Fluid Representation: </b>The simulator represents the combined fluid surface using level sets built from the particle system.
					<p><b>Incompressability: </b>Supports incompressible liquids by tracking and resolving overlapping particle positions.
					<p><b>Viscosity: </b>Each liquid in the simulation can have its own viscosity settings, allowing for anything from water to toothpaste to be simulated.
					<p><b>Modified Particle Level-Set Method: </b>To extract OBJ meshes from level-sets, we implemented a modified version of the Particle Level-Set Method. Our modified method works by moving helper particles through the level-set to find the liquid surface boundary, and then using the helper particles to create an up-sampled version of the level-set that is then converted to a mesh through marching cubes. 
				</div>
				<div class="projecttextrightbar">
					<p><b>Scene Loading: </b>Uses a custom scene format defining geometry, simulation boundaries, liquids, and liquid properties.
					<p><b>OBJ Mesh Import: </b>Supports importing OBJ meshes and simulating liquids against OBJ mesh objects and boundaries defined by OBJs. Starting liquid volumes can also be defined by OBJs.
					<p><b>OBJ Mesh Sequence Export: </b>Supports exporting the simulation as an OBJ mesh sequence suitable for use in Maya or any other 3D modeling/animation package.
					<p><b>Architecture: </b>Fully cross platform, compiles on OSX and Windows without modification and without external dependencies aside from the C++11 Standard Library itself. Internally includes GLM and stb_image for some linear algebra functions and for image output. Multithreaded using OpenMP.
					<p><b>Interface: </b>Includes a live OpenGL preview mode build using GLUT that displays the simulation as it progresses, with a moveable camera. Images from the live preview can be output alongside OBJ meshes.

				<div class="subtitle">Planned Future Improvements</div>
				<p>Although the class that this project was originally developed for has ended, we are planning to continue development with the following features:
				<div class="projecttextleftbar">
					<b>Bouyancy: </b>Support for fluids of differing densities interacting through bouyancy is planned and currently a high priority.
					<p><b>Better Mesh Reconstruction: </b>Implementing the full particle level-set method is being considered
					<p><b>Betted Interaction: </b>Although the current system includes a live preview mode, setting up the simulation system is still quite cumbersome and requires some scripting and coding. We hope to make simulation setup smoother down the road.
					<p><b>Additional Fluids: </b>We hope to add additional fluids such as smoke to the system in the future, but this feature is currently a low priority.
				</div>
				<div class="projecttextrightbar">
					<b>Various Bugfixes: </b>Currently some small glitches with the simulator exist, such as inverted normals in exported meshes. Fixing these problems is currently a high priority.
					<p><b>Maya OBJ Sequence Importing Tool: </b>We developed a simple utility for importing OBJ sequences to Maya, which we aim to release publicly once we have a chance to polish it a bit more.
					<p><b>Animated Scene: </b>Support for animating components of the scene and boundaries for liquids to interact with is planned.
