				<div class="subtitle">Overview</div>
				<p>Ariel is an experimental fluid simulator I wrote from scratch to explore the popular PIC/FLIP fluid solver algorithm and to evaluate <a href="http://www.openvdb.org/">OpenVDB</a>. Ariel supports arbitrary animated meshes as fluid starting volumes and as solid obstacles, and supports exact fluid-solid boundary finding through an integrated raycasting engine. Meshing can either be done natively in the simulator through OpenVDB, or through Houdini integration via <a href="http://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/partio.html">Partio</a>. This project is written entirely in C++.

				<p>This project has been under active development since 2013, although it is something more of a sandbox/hobby compared to the amount of focus I put into my main <a href="takuarender.html">renderer project</a>.

				<!-- <p><b>Notes</b>: at the request of the current <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis563/">Spring 2015 CIS563</a> TAs, I have temporarily made this project's Github repository private and will re-open it at the end of the current CIS563 term. If you are not in CIS563 and are curious to see this repo, email me for access. -->

				<div class="subtitle">Features</div>
				<div class="projecttextleftbar">
					<p><b>PIC/FLIP: </b>The core solver method used is the industry standard PIC/FLIP method. Supports solving using only PIC, only FLIP, or combining both as a weighted sum for PIC/FLIP. Supports particle resampling after particle advection for better fluid reconstruction.
					<p><b>Memory Efficient Grids: </b>Ariel supports both native float arrays and <a href="http://www.openvdb.org/">OpenVDB</a> as underlying data structures for storing grid information in the solver. Native float arrays are faster to access but use more memory and are therefore suitable for smaller simulations that require fast simulation times. OpenVDB grids are slower to access, but are more memory efficient and support sparse storage, allowing for extremely large scale simulations.
					<p><b>Animated Meshes: </b>Starting fluid volumes and solid obstacles can be specified through animated OBJ meshes. Fluid volumes can be added and subtracted from the simulation at any point in time, as can solid obstacles.
					<p><b>Live Preview: </b>The simulator comes with an OpenGL viewer complete with interactive camera and built in screen recording and debugging tools.
				</div>
				<div class="projecttextrightbar">
					<p><b>Raycast Solid-Fluid Boundaries: </b>Instead of finding solid-fluid boundaries through level sets, Ariel incorporates a modified version of Takua Render's fast intersection engine for finding precise solid-fluid boundaries by raycasting fluid particles against the scene's solid obstacles. This method allows for extremely precise fluid-solid boundary reconstruction and meshing.
					<p><b>Houdini Integration: </b>Ariel can interface with Houdini through OpenVDB volumes and can also write particle and simulation data directly to Houdini's native BGEO format through <a href="http://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/partio.html">Partio</a>. As a result, Ariel can either complete the entire simulation pipeline from particles all the way through meshing, or can complete only select portions of the simulation pipeline and offload to Houdini for functionality such as meshing.
					<p><b>Build Toolchain: </b>Ariel is written using C++11 and is multithreaded using <a href="https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/">Threaded Building Blocks</a>. Ariel builds on OSX using the native Clang/LLVM included with Xcode and on Windows using Visual Studio 2013. Ariel uses CMake for build file generation.
