				<div class="subtitle">Overview</div>
				<p>One of the spring 2012 <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis563/Spring2012/">CIS563: Physically Based Animation</a> assignments was a mass-spring damper system capable of simulating a single jello cube interacting against a plane. I took that project and extended it to allow for complex multiple jello interactions, interactions against arbitrary mesh scenes, Maya integration, multithreading, better integration methods, KD-Tree acceleration for intersection testing, and more. This project is written entirely in C++.
			</div>
			
			<div class="projecttextrow">
				<div class="subtitle">Base Code</div>
				<p>This project utilizes base code written by <a href="http://www.alinenormoyle.com/">Aline Normyle</a> for CIS563: Physically Based Animation.
			</div>

				<div class="subtitle">Features</div>
				<div class="projecttextleftbar">
					<p><b>Mass-spring Damper System: </b>The simulator models jello cubes as a lattice of masses connected with a variety of springs acting as constraints on shearing, compressing, and bending. Stiffness for each spring type can be specified at simulation initialization and can also be modified on the fly at runtime for more art-directable behavior.
					<p><b>Multiple Integration Schemes: </b>The simulator supports Euler, Midpoint, and fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration to solve the equations of motion in a discretized fashion. Integration schemes can be specified at simulation initialization and can also be modified on the fly at runtime to deal with any stability issues. The time step of the simulation can also be modified on the fly.
					<p><b>Arbitrary Surfaces: </b>In addition to support for jello interaction against planes, spheres, cylinders, and boxes, the system also supports interaction against arbitrary geometry loaded in as OBJ meshes. Meshes can also be dynamically unloaded and swapped out for different meshes, allowing for jello cubes to interact against a dynamic, changing, animated scene.
					<p><b>Live Preview: </b>The simulator comes with an OpenGL preview complete with interactive camera and built in screen recording and spring debugging tools.	
				</div>
				<div class="projecttextrightbar">
					<p><b>KD-Tree Acceleration: </b>A KD-Tree is used for accelerating intersection tests between jello vertices and scene surfaces. Rapid KD-Tree reconstruction is done every frame to account for changing jello positions and changing scene geometry.
					<p><b>Inter-jello Interaction: </b>Jello cubes can interact with each other instead of passing through each other. The simulator solves a single jello cube at a time while treating all other jellos in the scene as static meshes. Support for stacked jello is also included by having the simulator sort jello order by closeness to the ground before solving.
					<p><b>Maya Integration: </b>Maya integration is supported through a Python script that wraps the simulator and modifies vertex positions for cube meshes in Maya correspondingly. Simulations can also be exported as OBJ sequences for use in Maya and other programs.
					<p><b>Architecture: </b>The simulator has been modified from the original base code extensively; GLM is used as the math library instead of the original custom library, and various modifications have been made to allow for compilation without modification on Windows, OSX, and Fedora Linux. The live preview mode was also modified to use stb_image for image sequence output instead of DevIL. Multithreading through OpenMP was also added.
